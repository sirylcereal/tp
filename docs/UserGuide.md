# User Guide

**GreyBook** is a desktop application that helps **NUS clubs and societies efficiently manage students' contacts and track attendance**. It combines the speed and precision of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the convenience of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Optimised for users who prefer typing commands, GreyBook enables fast, streamlined management — letting you accomplish more in less time than with traditional GUI-based applications.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**New to a CLI?** It simply means typing short commands (like `add` or `list`) instead of clicking through menus and buttons. No need to use a mouse!

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Check Java Version**

   Open a terminal and ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.

   How do I open/use a terminal?</br>
   - Mac Users: Press `Cmd + Space`, type Terminal in search bar to open.
   - Windows Users: In the Windows Start menu search bar, type "Command Prompt" to open.
   - Linux Users: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to instantly open a terminal window

Type the following command exactly as you see it and press `Enter`.

   ```
   java -version
   ```

If you have Java 17 installed, you should see something similar to the following:

```
java version "17.0.12" 2024-07-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.12+8-LTS-286)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.12+8-LTS-286, mixed mode, sharing)
```

If you see a version number of 17 or above, you're all set.

Windows users: Follow <a href="https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html" target="_blank">this guide</a>.<br>
Linux users: Follow <a href="https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html" target="_blank">this guide</a>.<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. **Download GreyBook**

   Download the latest `.jar` file from the <a href="https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/releases/latest" target="_blank">latest release page</a>.<br>
   ![Where to download](images/githubDownload.png)

   By default, this will download `greybook.jar` to your **Downloads** folder. This will be your **home folder**, or in other words, where your GreyBook data is stored.<br>
   If you wish, you can copy or move `greybook.jar` anywhere you like to change its **home folder**.

2. **Launch the Application**

   If you did not move `greybook.jar`, it will be in your **Downloads** folder. Navigate (`cd`) to it by running the following commands in your terminal:<br>

   ```
   cd Downloads
   java -jar greybook.jar
   ```

   **Note**: These are two separate commands! Press `Enter` after each line to run them individually.<br>
   If you had moved `greybook.jar` elsewhere, replace `Downloads` with `greybook.jar`'s new filepath.

   > **macOS users:** If you see a security prompt the first time, right-click the `.jar` → **Open** → confirm.

3. **First Look**

   GreyBook should launch within a few seconds.
   A few sample students are preloaded so you can try out basic commands immediately.

## Command Format Summary

Here is some important information you need to understand the rest of the guide!

**Quick Notes about the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are called **parameters**, things you replace.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with a student's name, like `add n/John Doe`.

- Words in `"double quotation marks"` are called **literals**, things you type as-is (without the quotation marks).<br>
  e.g. in the command format of `mark "all"`, make sure you type out exactly `mark all`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/member` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items in round brackets are mutually exclusive. Pick only one!<br>
  e.g. `(INDEX | STUDENTID)` can be used as `1` or as `A0000000Y`.

- Items in **square** brackets with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (0 times), `t/member` (1 time), `t/member t/exco` (2 times), etc.

- Items in **curly** brackets with `+`​ after them can be used once or more times.<br>
  e.g. `{t/TAG}+​` can be used as `t/member` (1 time), `t/member t/exco` (2 times), etc.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. Type them out manually instead!

## Core Features

### Managing Students

GreyBook helps you store, edit, and track students' details with precision.

#### Adding Students: `add`

**Command:**
`add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL i/STUDENTID [t/TAG]…​`

**Parameters:**

- `n/NAME`: Student's full name

  <box type="warning" seamless>

  Note: A name can only contain letters, spaces, and certain special characters (`,`, `(`, `)`, `/`, `.`, `@`, `-`, `'`). Refer to the [Name Related Issues](#name-related-issues) in the FAQ for more details!

  </box>

- `p/PHONE`: 8-digit Singapore phone number or International phone numbers (following E.164 standard)
- `e/EMAIL`: Valid email address following RFC 5321/5322 email format standards

  <box type="warning" seamless>

  Note: Email validation follows <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321" target="_blank">RFC 5321</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322" target="_blank">RFC 5322</a> standards.

  </box>

- `i/STUDENTID`: Student's NUS ID (e.g., A0000000Y)

  <box type="warning" seamless>

  Note: We use a special checksum to validate the `STUDENTID` field, so only **valid** NUS Student IDs will be accepted!

  </box>

- `t/TAG`: Optional categories (e.g., `t/committee` or `t/freshman`)

  <box type="warning" seamless>
  Note: Only alphanumeric characters and `-` (dash) are allowed.
  </box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important: Duplicate Prevention**

Each student is uniquely identified by their **Student ID**. Two contacts with the same Student ID are considered duplicates and are not allowed.

**Example:**
- If `A0123456J` already exists in GreyBook, attempting to add another student with `i/A0123456J`, with all other fields different, will fail.
- Error message: `This person already exists in GreyBook`

**Note:** Students may share the same name, phone number, or email, but Student IDs must be unique.
</box>

**Examples:**

```
add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com i/A0000000Y
add n/Betsy Crowe p/87654321 e/betsycrowe@example.com i/A1111111M t/operations-team
```

**Expected Output:**

![result for adding Betsy Crowe](images/addBetsyResult.png)

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A student can have any number of tags (including 0)
</box>

---

#### Finding Students: `find`

**Command:** `find ​{(KEYWORD | i/ID_FRAGMENT | t/TAG_FRAGMENT)}+`

**Parameters:**

- `KEYWORD`: The name of the student
- `i/ID_FRAGMENT`: A substring of a student ID (e.g. `0Y` from `A0000000Y`)
- `t/TAG_FRAGMENT`: A substring of a tag (e.g. `ember` from `member`)
- You can provide any number of keywords, ID fragments and tag fragments
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`

Students matching at least one keyword or one student ID fragment will be returned.
e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:

- `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
- `find i/12345` returns anyone with student IDs containing `12345` (e.g. `A0123456J`)
- `find t/op` returns anyone with a tag containing `op` (e.g. `operations`)
- `find alex i/8L david t/cont` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`, anyone with student IDs containing `8L`, anyone with the tag containing `cont`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex i/8L david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing Students: `edit`

**Command:**
`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [i/STUDENTID] [t/TAG]…​`

**Parameters:**

- `INDEX`: The index number in the displayed student list (must be positive)
- Any combination of optional fields can be updated

**Behaviour:**

- Updates replace existing values
- When editing tags, the old tags are replaced entirely
- Use `t/` (empty) to remove all tags

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** After using the `edit` command, all filters applied from `find` will be removed!

</box>

**Examples:**

```
edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com
edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/
```

**Expected Output:**

![result for adding Betsy Crowe](images/editResult.png)

---

#### Listing All Students: `list`

**Command:** `list`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use this command after a `find` command to see all students again!
</box>

---

#### Deleting Students: `delete`

**Command:**
`delete (INDEX | STUDENTID)`

**Parameters:**

- `INDEX`: The index number in the displayed student list (must be positive)
- `STUDENTID`: Student's NUS ID (e.g., A0000000Y)

**Notes:**

- Provide either an index or a student ID — not both

Examples:

- Running `list`, then running `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in the GreyBook.
- Running `find Betsy`, then running `delete 1` deletes the 1st student in the results of the `find` command.
- `delete A0123456J` deletes the student with student ID A0123456J from the GreyBook.

---

#### Clearing all Students: `clear`

**Command:** `clear`

Deletes **all** entries from GreyBook.

### Managing Attendance

GreyBook helps you keep track of students' attendance efficiently.

#### Marking Attendance: `mark`

**Command:**
`mark (INDEX | STUDENTID | "all") (p/ | a/ | l/ | e/)`

**Flags:**

| Flag | Status  |
| ---- | ------- |
| `p/` | Present |
| `a/` | Absent  |
| `l/` | Late    |

**Examples:**

#### 1. Mark Student by Index or Student ID

```
mark 1 p/
mark A1234567X p/
```

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** When marking students by their Student ID, they do not have to be displayed in your filtered list of students.
</box>

##### Expected Output

![result for 'mark 1 p/' or 'mark A1234567X p/'](images/markIndexOrStudentIdResult.png)

#### 2. Mark All Students

```
mark all a/
```

##### Expected Output

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Unmarking Attendance: `unmark`

**Command:**
`unmark (INDEX | STUDENTID | "all")`

**Notes:**

- Provide **either** an index, a student ID **or** "all" — not both nor "all"
- Unmarking a student with no attendance status will have no effect

**Examples:**

#### 1. Unmark Student by Index or Student ID

```
unmark 1
unmark A1234567X
```

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** When unmarking students by their Student ID, they do not have to be displayed in your filtered list of students.
</box>

##### Expected Output

![result for 'unmark 1' or 'unmark A1234567X'](images/unmarkIndexOrStudentIdResult.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Application Controls

GreyBook also offers some core commands that are essential in every application.

#### Getting Help: `help`

**Command:** `help`

Shows a pop-up containing the GreyBook User Guide URL (this webpage). Copy the link into your browser to access the guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

---

#### Exiting the Application: `exit`

**Command:** `exit`

Closes GreyBook.

---

### Miscellaneous Features

#### Terminal-like Behaviour

Want to rerun a command you typed before? Similar to a typical CLI application, use the **up or down arrows** to navigate your command history. You can also use Ctrl+C to clear the current command!

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** If you have selected some text in the command, `Ctrl+C` will not clear your command. This way, you can still use `Ctrl+C` to copy the text!
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution! For advanced users**
The command history is saved in the hard disk automatically after every successful command as a JSON file at: `[JAR file location]/history.json`.
It is not recommended to modify this file to alter your command history. If your changes to the history file make it invalid, GreyBook will discard all history and start fresh on the next run. Before you edit, make a backup copy of the file.
</box>

---

#### Automatic Saving of Data

GreyBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

The data is saved as a JSON file at: <br>
`[JAR file location]/data/greybook.json` <br>

By default, your data file is located at: <br>
`Downloads/data/greybook.json`<br>
Open the Downloads folder in your preferred File Explorer to check it out!

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution!**
Editing this file is recommended for advanced users only. If your changes to the data file make it invalid, GreyBook will discard all data and start fresh on the next run. Before you edit, make a backup copy of the file.
Some changes can cause the GreyBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Recommended Workflows (for experienced users)

Here are some unique ways to combine commands to increase your efficiency with GreyBook. <br>

**Scenario 1**: I know the expected headcount, and one person is excused. My on-site count matches that.<br>
Recommended Flow: `mark` all students as present, `find` the excused student and `mark` accordingly. <br>

```
mark all p/
find Jason
mark 1 e/
list
```

---

**Scenario 2**: I have late arrivals that I need to mark.<br>
Recommended Flow: `find` the late arrivals and `mark all l/`. No need to look for latecomers manually! <br>

```
find jack jill
mark all l/
list
```

---

**Scenario 3**: Students are trickling in and I need to mark them as present one by one.<br>
Recommended Flow: Type a `find` command followed by student names as they arrive. When you have the time, execute the `find` command and `mark all p/` to mark those that arrived so far.<br>

```
find john sally jason maria
mark all p/
find tommy larry
...
```

---

## Full Command Format Details

For advanced users who wish to use special characters like quotation marks (`"`) in your arguments, do take note of these advanced command formats.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If a prefix for the command occurs in the argument, you may use quotation marks `"` to escape it.
  e.g. `SomeCommandName p/"p-Slash t/ contains t-Slash" t/tag`

- If you want to use quotation marks `"` in your argument, you have to escape them with a backslash `\`
  e.g. `SomeCommandName t/Quote: \"`

- Likewise, if you want to use backslashes `\` in your argument, you have to escape them with a backslash.
  e.g. `SomeCommandName t/Backslash: \\`

## FAQs

### Installation & Requirements

**Q: What operating systems does GreyBook support?**<br>
**A:** Any system that can run Java 17+ (Windows, macOS, Linux). If Java 17 runs, GreyBook runs.

**Q: Do I need to install anything besides GreyBook?**<br>
**A:** Yes, **Java 17 or newer**. Check with `java -version`. If it's older, install a current Long Term Support Java version.

### Updating & Migration

**Q: How do I update GreyBook to a new version?**<br>
**A:** Download the new `.jar` and run it. Your existing data in `data/greybook.json` will be picked up automatically if you keep it in the same folder.

**Q: Will I lose my data when I update?**<br>
**A:** No. The data file is separate from the app. Keep `data/greybook.json` with the `.jar` and you're good.

**Q: Can I move GreyBook to another computer (or a USB drive)?**<br>
**A:** Yes. Copy the `.jar` **and** the `data` folder together, as well as the config and preferences files, `config.json` and `preferences.json` respectively. If you want to transfer the command history as well, copy over the file `history.json`. On the new computer, simply run `java -jar greybook.jar`.

### Data Location, Saving & Backup

**Q: Where exactly is my data?**<br>
**A:** In `[JAR file location]/data/greybook.json`. By default, it will be in `Downloads/data/greybook.json`

**Q: Does GreyBook save automatically?**<br>
**A:** Yes. Changes are saved to `greybook.json` right after each command.

**Q: How do I back up my data?**<br>
**A:** Close GreyBook and copy `data/greybook.json` to a safe place (cloud/storage drive).

**Q: I edited the JSON and something broke. What now?**<br>
**A:** Close GreyBook, restore your backup `greybook.json`, then reopen GreyBook. Avoid manual edits unless you're confident.

**Q: How do I reset GreyBook to factory data?**<br>
**A:** Close the app, delete `data/greybook.json`, and reopen GreyBook (you'll start fresh with sample data).

### Search Behaviour

**Q: Are name searches case-sensitive?**<br>
**A:** No. `hans` matches `Hans`.

**Q: How do tags work?**<br>
**A:** Add any number: `t/member t/freshman`. Editing tags **replaces** the old set. Use `t/` (empty) to clear all tags.

### Limits & Performance

**Q: Is there an undo command?**<br>
**A:** Not currently. Actions like `delete` and `clear` are immediate and irreversible. Consider regular backups of `data/greybook.json`.

**Q: Can I store addresses or other fields?**<br>
**A:** Only the fields shown in the command formats are supported (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `i/`, and tags).

**Q: How many students can I store?**<br>
**A:** There's no hard limit in the app; performance depends on your computer.

### Name Related Issues

**Q: What characters are allowed in the name field?**<br>
**A:** Only alphabets and the following special characters are allowed: `(Empty space)`, `,`, `(`, `)`, `/`, `.`, `@`, `-`, `'`.

**Q: My name contains a character that is not allowed in the name. How should I enter my name?**<br>
**A:** Please use standard English (Latin) letters only.
For example, if your name is "محمد", you can enter it as "Mohamed". If your name is "李华", you can enter it as "Li Hua".
Similarly, if your name contains special characters such as accents or diacritics (e.g. "José", "Strauß"), please remove them — e.g. "Jose", "Straus".

**Q: Why are some special characters allowed but not others?**<br>
**A:** This is due to the limitation of the program, as we are unable to support every single possible Unicode character. We defer this decision to <a href="https://partnersupport.singpass.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/32733563138585-What-are-the-special-characters-allowed-in-Myinfo-Name-data-item" target="_blank">Singapore's Myinfo</a> for supported special characters.
